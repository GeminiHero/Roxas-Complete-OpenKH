ABOUT
------
This mod is a combination of 3 mods; "Full Playable Roxas" by Napstio, and "Sora Replacement", "Sora and Folks". This mod was compiled for use in OpenKH by KoalToal.

The additional "Coat" version of this mod also combines the "Playable Organization Roxas Everywhere" mod from Napstio.

As a result, this mod fully replaces Sora in all gameplay, cutscenes, and minigames with Roxas, and replaces Roxas with Sora in Simulated Twilight Town, and as the story/Data boss fight. Courtesy of the Napstio mod, Roxas has unique designs for all his Drive Forms and World costumes, as well as a unique Station image (credit to Feranelia on DA for the Station image, and to Reseliee on DA for the Halloween Roxas design)

This compilation adds new voice mods for Roxas and Sora, as well as fixes many bugs with the original, making it currently the only Roxas mod to be fully functional with the GoA Randomizer.

FIX LOG (COAT)

KNOWN ISSUES (BOTH)
---------------
- Atlantica Roxas' LQ model's face textures are off-center. This may be difficult to fix with the current tools available (but looks hilarious if terrifying)
- Halloween Roxas' LQ model's face textures do not move. This is a result of the complex texturing needed for Halloween Town costumes, and may be very difficult to fix.
- Org Coat Sora's LQ model face textures, similarly, do not move. This may be addressed in a later patch, but is only visible in a couple cutscenes and not gameplay.
- Halloween Roxas' HQ Model's mouth will clip beneaeth his jaw in some cutscenes. Unlikely to be fixed in the near future.
- Some cutscenes in Theater Mode will instead load you into an area in the game; the cause of this problem is unknown, but be careful using theater mode! Does not cause crashes to my knowledge. (Potentially avoidable by using Theater mode straight from the main menu instead of loading a game first and then returning to the title screen!)
- Applying 1.1 to KH2FM without also applying or having applied a translation patch will cause the system text to break, and lead to a great number of bugs. SOLUTION: Apply only the "No Script Change" version of the patch if you want to play the mod without a translation applied! (It is unlikely this will be addressed in the future, as it would require rewriting the Japanese script, which will have to be left to other modders if there is an interest)
- Roxas will T-Pose and fall to the ground during the final Xemnas fight during the "Can You Spare A Heart?" phase; as it does not affect gameplay this glitch is considered low priority, but may still be fixed at some point in the future.

KNOWN ISSUE(S) (COMPLETE)
---------------
- Roxas' High Quality model will sometimes not unload properly, causing certain parts of his mesh (namely his hair, eyes, and chain) to float in some cutscenes.

KNOWN ISSUE(S) (COAT)
--------------
- Entering the "Party" menu in areas such as Port Royale while Jack is in the party will cause a model glitch in the preview window. The cause of this is unknown, but is theorized to be related to Coat Roxas' high filesize causing a small RAM overflow. Does not result in crashes, and is limited in scope.
